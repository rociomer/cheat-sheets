# cheat-sheets
General compchem "cheat sheets" — notes on commands and packages that I use a lot in my day-to-day work.

This started as a list of commands I tend to forget (and keep on post-its by my desk), but I am slowly expanding it with additional commands and tools that come in handy when introducing others to research in the field.

Overview:
* [conda.md](./conda.md) - useful commands for using conda
* [git.md](./git.md) - useful Git commands
* [jupyter-notebooks.md](./jupyter-notebooks.md) - useful commands for working with Jupyter notebooks
* [latex.md](./latex.md) - useful tools when using LaTeX
* [python.md](./python.md) - nice tools for working with Python
* [slurm.md](./slurm.md) - useful commands for using SLURM
* [tensorboard.md](./tensorboard.md) - useful commands for using Tensorboard
* [vim.md](./vim.md) - a quick guide to using the Vim text editor
* [vscode.md](./vscode.md) - useful VSCode extensions
* [windows.md](./windows.md) - tools for working in Windows
